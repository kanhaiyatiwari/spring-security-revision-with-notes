Introduction
Security:
It is for protecting data and business logic inside our application.
Security is a non-functional requirement:
Function requirement: what type of real business functionality. what type of pages.
Non-functional requirements: security, scalability. performance, availability, etc.
Security Fundamentals:
In any system we have some resources like a REST API, a web application, a database, a resource in the cloud.
We have identities: Identities need to access to resources and perform actions. for example, execute a Rest API call
read/modify data.

Important Security Principles:
1. Trust nothing
Validate every request
Validate piece of data or information that comes into the system.
2. Assign Least privileges
Start the design the system with security requirement in mind.
Have a clear picture of the user roles and access.
Assign minimum possible privileges at all levels.
Application level
Infrastructures(database + servers + )
3. Have complete mediation
Everyone has to pass through one main gate.
Test the role and access of each user.
4. Have defense in depth
Multiple level of security (In Transport layer, Network layer, Infrastructures layer, application layer, OS layer)
5. Have Economy of Mechanism
Security architecture should be simple.
